- Added temperature (0.5) and max_tokens (1024) parameters
- Implemented better error handling:
  - Added response.ok checks
  - Added specific error messages for different HTTP status codes
  - Added response data validation
  - Improved error logging for debugging
- Updated error messages to be more specific about Groq-related issues

### 2. Chat Interface Updates (js/chat-interface.js)
- Changed API key storage from 'openai_api_key' to 'groq_api_key'
- Updated UI text to reference Groq instead of OpenAI
- Added API key setup improvements:
  - Added link to wow.groq.com for getting an API key
  - Updated placeholder text for API key input
  - Added help text with link to Groq website
  - Added change/reset API key button in header
  - Implemented ability to change API key at any time

### 3. Styling Updates (css/chat.css)
- Added styles for API key help text
- Added styles for the Groq API key link
- Added hover states for links
- Used VSCode theme variables for consistent styling
- Added styles for change API key button
- Updated header layout to accommodate new button

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test with valid Groq API key
   - Test error scenarios:
     - Invalid API key
     - Rate limiting
     - Network errors
   - Test code analysis features:
     - General code analysis
     - Compilation error analysis
     - Code selection analysis

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation with Groq API key setup instructions
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common Groq API issues
   - Document rate limits and usage guidelines

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states during API calls
   - Add better error visualization
   - Consider adding API key validation before saving
   - Add option to clear/reset API key

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor and optimize response times
   - Consider implementing request caching
   - Add request timeout handling
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests

5. **Security**
   - Review API key storage security
   - Implement proper API key validation
   - Add rate limiting on client side
   - Add input sanitization

6. **Features**
   - Consider adding model selection options
   - Add temperature/token limit controls
   - Consider streaming responses
   - Add conversation history management

## Known Issues
- Fixed API endpoint and model name based on official Groq example
- Added ability to change/reset API key through UI button
- Confirmed Groq API integration is working properly
- Improved user experience with API key management
- Need to verify rate limiting behavior
- Need to test with large code samples
- Need to verify token limits with Groq's model

## Dependencies
- Groq API access required
- Updated chat-interface.js
- Updated ai-service.js
- Updated chat.css

## Additional Notes
- The migration maintains all existing functionality while improving error handling
- Users will need to obtain a new Groq API key
- The UI now provides clearer guidance for API key setup
- Error messages are more specific and helpful
- Users can now easily change or reset their API key through the UI
- The implementation follows Groq's official API example
